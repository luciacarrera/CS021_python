# Program used to create a multiplication table according to user input

## INPUT
# get user to input a starting number for the range
start = int(input("Enter a positive starting value < 1000: "))

# if invalid input ask user again until start is correct
while (start <= 0 or start >= 1000):
    start= int(input(f"{start} is not a valid choice, try again\nEnter a positive starting value < 1000: "))

# get user to input an ending number for the range
end = int(input("Enter a positive ending value less than 1000 and greater than the starting value: "))

# if invalid input ask user again until end is correct
while (end <= 0 or end >= 1000 or end <= start):
    end= int(input(f"{end} is not a valid choice, try again\nEnter a positive starting value < 1000: "))

# newlines printed for readability
print("\n\n")
